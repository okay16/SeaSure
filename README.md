Here is Code for Hack for Earth 2020 - Animal Wellbeing category. I participated alone in this 36 hour long hackathon.

My idea was to detect illegal fishing using a GPS tracking model. If any user's phone GPS coordinates reflected a location outside a country's economic fishing zones, the local fishing authorities would be alerted. This alert would be in the form of a text message with the violator's coordinates, time of violation and type of violation.
